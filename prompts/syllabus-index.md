# SYLLABUS INDEX CONSTRUCTION TASK

You are an expert in analysing and structuring educational syllabi. Your task is to carefully read the provided syllabus, extract all the knowledge points, and organize them into a structured JSON format. Each knowledge point should be assigned a unique ID based on its hierarchical position in the syllabus. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the Syllabus:** Carefully analyze the syllabus content, paying attention to the hierarchy of topics, subtopics, and individual knowledge points.

2. **Extract Knowledge Points:** Identify all the knowledge points listed under each topic and subtopic. These are typically statements that describe what a candidate should know or be able to do.

3. **Assign Unique IDs:** Assign a unique ID to each knowledge point based on its position in the syllabus hierarchy. Use the following format:
   - For main topics: `X.Y.Z`, where:
     - `X` is the main topic number (e.g., 1 for "Information Representation").
     - `Y` is the subtopic number (e.g., 1 for "Data Representation").
     - `Z` is the knowledge point number within the subtopic (e.g., 1 for the first knowledge point).

4. **Create JSON Structure:** Organize the knowledge points into a JSON array of objects. Each object should have two keys:
   - `id`: The unique ID of the knowledge point.
   - `description`: A concise description of the knowledge point.

5. **Output the JSON:** Provide the final output in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": "X.Y.Z",
      "description": "description of the knowledge point"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Example Input (Syllabus Excerpt):**

```markdown
### 4.2 Assembly Language
Candidates should be able to:
- Show understanding of the relationship between assembly language and machine code.
- Describe the different stages of the assembly process for a two-pass assembler.
- Trace a given simple assembly language program.

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "points": [
    {
      "id": "4.2.1",
      "description": "assembly language and machine code"
    },
    {
      "id": "4.2.2",
      "description": "stages of assembler"
    },
    {
      "id": "4.2.3",
      "description": "assembly tracing"
    },
    {
      "id": "4.2.4",
      "description": "instruction set group"
    },
    {
      "id": "4.2.5",
      "description": "modes of addressing"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Instructions:**

1. Follow the steps above to process the entire syllabus.
2. Ensure the IDs are consistent with the hierarchy of the syllabus.
3. Keep the descriptions concise but clear.
4. Output the final JSON in a well-formatted structure.
